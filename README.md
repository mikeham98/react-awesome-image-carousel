    render() {
        return (
            <Calendar

## Calendar
### Props
#### Summary
|Name                   |Type         |Description                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|events                 |array        |Events is an array that can be passed into the calendar and will render events on the Monthly and Daily view  |
|header                 |component    |This allows you to provide a custom header component for the calendar                                         |
|onChange               |function     |This will be called every time the calendar changes date or mode                                              |
|onClickEvent           |function     |This function is called on click of an event on the daily mode                                                |
|onClickTimeLine        |function     |This function is called on click of the timeline present on the daily calendar mode                                                |
|ref                    |ref          |By passing in a ref it enables the ability to call methods on the Calendar class e.g. getDetails              |                         |

#### events

The events array prop has the following shape
```bash
{
    id: (string or numeric) - this is used to uniquely identify an event,
    color: (hex or RBG/RGBA value) - this sets the event color on the calendar,
    from: (utc timestamp) - start date/time of event e.g. '2019-05-05T13:00:00+00:00',
    to: (utc timestamp) - end date/time of event e.g. '2019-05-05T20:00:00+00:00',
    title: (string) - name of event
}
```
I would recommend retrieving events on a per month basis to improve performance.

#### header
If you wish to provide a customer header component you can pass in a prop which will override the header used by default. The following props will be passed into this component:

##### props

```bash
{
    current: {
        year: numeric,
        month: numeric,
        day: numeric
    },
    mode: "dailyMode" || "monthlyMode" || "yearlyMode" - this can be used to determine what the current mode of the calender is. This way you can choose whether to show a year, month or day depending on the mode,
    prev: {
        year: numeric,
        month: numeric,
        day: numeric
    },
    next: {
        year: numeric,
        month: numeric,
        day: numeric
    },
    onClickPrev: function - this will change the calendar to the prev year, month, day depending on the mode
    onClickNext: function - this will change the calendar to the next year, month, day depending on the mode
}
```

#### onChange
The onChange prop is a function that will be called on change of the mode (year, month, day) or previous/next calendar. the mode, year, month, day values will be passed in.
##### Example
```bash
(date) => {
    console.log(date)
    /* result (1st January 2019 viewed in the monthly calendar view)
        {
            mode: 'monthlyMode',
            year: 2019,
            month: 0,
            day: 1
        }
    */
}
```

#### onClickEvent
The onClickEvent prop is a function that will be called on click of an event on the Day mode of the calendar. The event id will be passed through to the function as an argument
##### Example
```bash
(event) => {
    console.log(event)
    /* result
       42
    */
}
```

#### onClickTimeLine
The onClickTimeLine prop is a function that will be called on click of the timeline present on the  on the Day mode of the calendar. The year month date and hour (0-24 with a resolution of 0.5) will be passed through to the function as an argument
##### Example
```bash
(date) => {
    console.log(date)
    /* result
        {
            year: 2019,
            month: 0,
            day: 1,
            hour: 15.5
        }
    */
}
```

#### ref
Passing in a ref allows you to call methods on the Calendar class. A particularly useful method would be getDetails which return the current
mode, year, month, day.
##### Example
```bash
import React from 'react';
import Calendar from "react-awesome-calendar";

export default class Component extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.calendar = React.createRef();
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        const details = this.calendar.current.getDetails();
        console.log(details);
        /* result
            {
                mode: 'monthlyMode',
                year: 2019,
                month: 0,
                day: 1
            }
        */
        // call endpoint to retrieve events
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <Calendar
                ref={this.calendar}
                events={this.props.events}
            />
        );
    }
}
```
